Discord Trading Bot: A Python bot that fetches price data from stntrading.eu and backpack.classifieds, compares buying and selling prices, and alerts Discord users if the prices are within 10% of each other.
 Discord Trading Bot

This Python-based bot fetches live market data from [stntrading.eu](https://stntrading.eu) and [backpack.classifieds](https://backpack.classifieds), compares buying and selling prices, and sends a "Good deal found" message to a Discord server if the prices are within 10% of each other. It allows users to stay informed about potentially profitable deals in real time.

 Features
- Fetches buying and selling prices from [stntrading.eu](https://stntrading.eu) and [backpack.classifieds](https://backpack.classifieds).
- Compares the prices and checks if they are within 10% of each other.
- Sends an alert to a specified Discord channel when a "good deal" is found.
- Easily configurable to suit different trading strategies.

 Setup & Installation

 Prerequisites
Before running the bot, make sure you have:
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- A [Discord bot token](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro).
- Internet access for fetching data from the APIs.

 Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/discord-trading-bot.git
   cd discord-trading-bot

Install dependencies: Create a virtual environment (optional, but recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install required Python libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Configure the bot:

Create a .env file in the project root to store your sensitive credentials
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token

Run the bot: Start the bot by running
python bot.py

Customization
Discord Channel: Modify the channel ID in the code where the bot sends messages to a Discord channel.
Price Comparison: The bot compares the prices fetched from stntrading.eu and backpack.classifieds. You can adjust the percentage threshold (currently set to 10%) for what is considered a "good deal".

How It Works
The bot fetches current market prices from both stntrading.eu and backpack.classifieds.
It compares the buying and selling prices for each item.
If the prices are within 10% of each other, it sends an alert message to a Discord channel saying "Good deal found!".

Usage
Once the bot is running, it will fetch data at regular intervals and send a message to your Discord channel if it detects a "good deal."
